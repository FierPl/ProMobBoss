# ================================================================= #

# Boss Scheduler & Announcement Settings
boss-scheduler:
  # How often the scheduler checks for upcoming boss spawns.
  # Value is in ticks (20 ticks = 1 second).
  # Lower values are more precise but use more resources. 20 is ideal for per-second checks.
  check-interval: 20

  announcements:
    # A list of announcements to be broadcasted before a boss spawns.
    # 'time': The time in seconds before the spawn.
    # 'message-path': The path to the message in your language file (e.g., en_US.yml).
    # You can add or remove as many announcements as you like.
    before-spawn:
      - { time: 300, message-path: "announcements.boss.five-minutes" }
      - { time: 60, message-path: "announcements.boss.sixty-seconds" }
      - { time: 30, message-path: "announcements.boss.thirty-seconds" }
      - { time: 10, message-path: "announcements.boss.ten-seconds" }

    # Countdown that starts when 5 (or less) seconds are remaining.
    countdown:
      enabled: true
      # At which second the countdown should start.
      start-from: 5
      # The message path in your language file. %time% will be replaced with the remaining seconds.
      message-path: "announcements.boss.countdown"

    # The message broadcasted at the exact moment the boss spawns.
    on-spawn:
      enabled: true
      message-path: "announcements.boss.spawned"

# Mob Spawner Settings (This section is for the automatic mob spawning system in worlds)
# We will implement this in a future phase.
mob-spawner:
  # Should the automatic mob spawner be enabled?
  enabled: true
  # How often the spawner attempts to spawn mobs in the world (in seconds).
  spawn-interval-seconds: 60

# Leaderboard Settings
leaderboard:
  # How often should holograms using leaderboard placeholders be updated (in seconds)?
  hologram-update-interval: 300 # 5 minutes

  # How long should the fetched leaderboard data be cached in memory to avoid frequent database queries (in seconds)?
  cache-duration: 600 # 10 minutes

# Other system settings can be added here in the future.
